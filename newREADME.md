//Welcome to a brief description of my program

This application generates passwords ranging from 8 to 128 characters in length.
It creates an array of different characters from the users selections.

A slider was used to prevent errors from the user entering invalid options.

The program will not run without at least one of the character types being selected.

After clicking the "generate" button once, a user who would like a different password with the same options(or different) can click the button again and receive a new password.

**Enjoy**
